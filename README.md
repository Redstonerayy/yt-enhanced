# Youtube Looper Extension

An extension to loop youtube videos inside the browser (on the official youtube webpage).
It's possible to specify how often the video should be looped. Note that the times looped don't
reset when the max loop count is adjusted.

# Issues

If things go wrong, you have feature ideas or youtube changed their UI and the looper is broken,
just open an issue on Github.
